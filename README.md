# üíª Hacker-Themed Code Editor

## Overview
The Hacker-Themed Code Editor is an interactive, web-based code playground created by Roshan Kumar Prajapati. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to write and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. The editor features a sleek, hacker-inspired design with an animated background, three input textareas for code, and a live output iframe. It is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, offering a dynamic and engaging coding experience.

## Features
- **Code Editor** ‚úçÔ∏è:
  - Three textareas for writing HTML (`html-code`), CSS (`css-code`), and JavaScript (`js-code`) with placeholders for guidance.
- **Live Output** üñ•Ô∏è:
  - An iframe (`output-frame`) displays the real-time result of the combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- **Animated Background** ‚ú®:
  - A dynamic background (`animated-background`) with hacker-themed effects (e.g., matrix-style animations, implemented via CSS or JavaScript).
- **Responsive Design** üì±:
  - Optimized for various screen sizes using CSS media queries.
- **Hacker Aesthetic** üïµÔ∏è:
  - Styled with a dark, tech-inspired theme to evoke a hacker vibe, including neon accents and monospaced fonts (defined in `style.css`).

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Structure of the editor, including textareas, iframe, and container elements.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the editor, output, animated background, and responsiveness (`style.css`).
- **JavaScript**: Logic for updating the iframe with user code and handling animations (`script.js`, `hide.js`).

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) with JavaScript support.
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code) for customization.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-Roshan/hacker-code-editor.git
cd hacker-code-editor
```

### 2. Open the Website
- Open `index.html` in a web browser:
  ```bash
  open index.html  # macOS
  start index.html  # Windows
  ```
- Alternatively, use a local development server (e.g., VS Code Live Server) for better performance.

### 3. Customize (Optional)
- Edit `style.css` to modify the hacker-themed design, colors, or animations.
- Update `script.js` to enhance code execution (e.g., add error handling, live preview optimizations).
- Modify `hide.js` to adjust the animated background (e.g., change animation effects) or clarify its role.
- Update `index.html` to add features like syntax highlighting or additional input fields.

## Usage
1. **Write Code** ‚úçÔ∏è: Enter HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in the respective textareas.
2. **View Output** üñ•Ô∏è: See the real-time result of your code in the iframe.
3. **Animated Background** ‚ú®: Enjoy the hacker-themed animated background.
4. **Responsive** üì±: Access the editor on mobile or desktop for a consistent experience.

## Deployment
- **Static Hosting**:
  1. Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and `hide.js` to a hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
  2. Configure the service to serve `index.html` as the entry point.
- **GitHub Pages Example**:
  1. Push the repository to GitHub.
  2. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings, selecting the `main` branch.
  3. Access the site at `https://the-roshan.github.io/hacker-code-editor`.
- **Netlify Example**:
  1. Drag the project folder into Netlify‚Äôs dashboard.
  2. Deploy and use the provided URL.
- **Local Server**:
  ```bash
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```
  Visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Notes
- **JavaScript Logic**:
  - `script.js` must implement logic to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the textareas and render the result in the iframe (e.g., using `iframe.contentWindow.document`).
  - `hide.js` likely handles the animated background (e.g., matrix-style effects or canvas animations); its exact purpose should be verified.
- **Styling**: The `style.css` file should define the hacker-themed design, including dark backgrounds, neon accents, and responsive layout for the editor and output sections.
- **Enhancements**: Consider adding syntax highlighting (e.g., via a library like Prism.js), error feedback, or a save/load feature for code snippets.
- **SEO**: Add meta tags in `<head>` (e.g., `description`, `keywords`) for better visibility, e.g., "Hacker-themed code editor by Roshan Kumar Prajapati".
- **License**: Include the MIT License in `LICENSE.md` to clarify usage terms (as provided previously).
